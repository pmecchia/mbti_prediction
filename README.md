# MBTI Prediction
:date: Creation date: October 2020

## :dart: Objective

The Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories:

 * introversion or extraversion
 * sensing or intuition
 * thinking or feeling
 * judging or perceiving
 
The goal was to create a web application that could predict the MBTI of a person with a text description.
The model is trained on the following dataset:
